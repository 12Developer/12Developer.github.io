Simon is a memory game that challenges you to repeat a sequence of flashing colors.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript.  


 I started with my basic html boilerplate. Then I was able to style my html using CSS and jQuery. The functionality of my game was not too difficult, being that I used google and youtube. This is my project and I hope you enjoy it.
